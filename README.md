# cons-rs

A crate containing a singly-linked list.

As of 0.4.1, cons-rs supports `#[no_std]` environments.
Note that it still depends on the [`alloc`] crate.

[`alloc`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/alloc

## Breaking Update Changelog

### 0.7.0
This version locks the entire `immutable` module behind a crate feature.

It also flips the Extend and IntoIterator implementations, so
creating a list from `[1, 2]` and popping off of it will yield 1 and then 2.

### 0.6.0
This version is a **full** rewrite of the entire crate. 
It has migrated from its past as a "list of nested pairs"
to what it has actually been the entire time, a singly-linked list.

The main reason I didn't publish this as a new crate is because
all the names are taken, and the *use cases* are mostly the same.
